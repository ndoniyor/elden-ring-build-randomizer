# elden-ring-build-randomizer
Elden Ring Build Randomizer built in Flask

## To-Do
- [ ] Add column to ash of war/sorcery/incantation csv indicating type (user can specify what kind of build)
- [x] Add column to weapon csv indicating type (user can specify what kind of weapons)
- [ ] Add full randomizer (no bias) and refined randomizer
- [x] If weapon is a bow - find bow Ash of War
- [x] Create item class so link can be stored without list
- [x] Update spells player class member to be a list of type 'item'
- [x] Split up table to be more narrow and easier to read
- [x] Delete talismans and staffs, I figure people will just go with whatever suits the spells that were chosen
- [ ] Integrate JS and Jquery for more responsive webpage
