# elden-ring-build-randomizer
Elden Ring Build Randomizer built in Flask

## To-Do
- [ ] Add column to ash of war/sorcery/incantation csv indicating type (user can specify what kind of build)
- [ ] Add column to weapon csv indicating type (user can specify what kind of weapons)
- [ ] Add full randomizer (no bias) and refined randomizer
- [ ] If weapon is a bow - find bow Ash of War
- [ ] Create item class so link can be stored without list
- [ ] Update spells player class member to be a list of type 'item'
- [x] Split up table to be more narrow and easier to read
- [ ] Delete talismans and staffs, I figure people will just go with whatever suits the spells that were chosen
